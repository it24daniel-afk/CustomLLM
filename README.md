# **Project Title:** CustomLLM From Scratch: 
- The Complete Journey to Building a Large Language Model

---

## **Repository Description:**
This repository is the documented adventure of my hands-on journey to build a large language model (LLM) entirely from scratch. It represents a comprehensive, end-to-end expedition from the very first lines of tokenization code to a fully functional GPT-style model.

---

### **My Adventure in AI:**
Follow my step-by-step path through the entire landscape of LLM development. This isn't just code—it's a chronicle of the challenges, breakthroughs, and practical learnings from my personal deep dive into artificial intelligence. Every component is built with educational clarity, supported by detailed video tutorials that guide you through the same journey I undertook.

### **The Journey's Milestones:**
- **Foundation:** Beginning with core concepts like text tokenization and data preparation.
- **Architecture:** The adventure of constructing the transformer model block by block.
- **Training Odyssey:** The intensive process of pre-training on unlabeled data and the focused journey of fine-tuning for specific tasks.
- **Optimization Expedition:** Navigating the challenges of running and training sophisticated models on accessible hardware, including my own setup:
  - **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700G
  - **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12 GB VRAM)
  - **RAM:** 16 GB
- **Full Workflow:** Complete with data chunking strategies, evaluation protocols, and performance tuning techniques learned along the way.
